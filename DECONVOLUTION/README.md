# Example of data deconvolution

1) HCR_brain.txt = expression matrix from Berto el al. 2018

2) Allen_MTG.RData = file with expression and cluster association from the human middle temporal gyrus (MTG) single nuclei RNA-seq. File size too big for GitHub. Contact first author. 

3) Deconvolution.R = example code for deconvolution and visualization (e.g. fig. S2).

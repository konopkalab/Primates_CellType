# Gene set data

Each .RData contains lists of genes selected for enrichment and overlap from different sources. 

1) Disorders = List of genes associated with autism, FMRP, Intellectual disability and synaptic etiologies. 

2) RareVar = List of rare variants associated genes from Gandal et al. 2018.

3) Regulators = List of RNA-binding proteins and Transcription factors from multiple studies. 

4) Evolution = List of human specifically expressed genes from multiple studies.

5) PsychENCODE_modules = List of modules from Gandal et al. 2018. 

6) PsychENCODE_DEGs = List of differentially expressed genes from Gandal et al. 2018.
